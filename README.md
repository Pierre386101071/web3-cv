## Web3 Project – Ethereum Faucet DApp

### Repository

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Pierre386101071/faucet-dapp-sepolia
- **Contract (Sepolia):** `0xf49fc27b1a9299d2f7ef88b8034eca88a908f520`  
- **Etherscan (Sepolia):** https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xF49fc27B1A9299D2f7Ef88B8034eca88A908F520

### Description

A decentralized faucet smart contract that allows users to claim 0.01 ETH every 24 hours, with a maximum claim limit of 1 ETH per wallet. The project includes a basic front-end built in HTML/JavaScript, integrated with MetaMask using ethers.js.

### Features

- Claim limit: 0.01 ETH per 24h per user
- Maximum claim cap: 1 ETH per wallet
- Owner-only funding and withdrawal
- Mapping-based user tracking and access control
- `Claimed(address, timestamp)` event emitted on every claim
- Front-end dApp fully connected to Sepolia testnet and MetaMask

### Stack

- Solidity (contract logic)
- HTML/CSS + JavaScript
- ethers.js (contract interaction)
- Sepolia testnet
- MetaMask (wallet integration)

### Skills Demonstrated

- Smart contract inheritance and access control (modifier + admin rights)
- Secure logic (timestamp checking, max caps, ETH transfer)
- Real-world contract deployment on Sepolia
- Decentralized front-end development and wallet connection

## Current Goal

I am looking to:

- Join a technically focused DAO (engineering, tooling, or governance)
- Contribute to bounties and real projects involving Solidity or dApp development
- Deepen my knowledge of DAO architecture, token systems, and smart contract governance
- Build and ship useful open-source Web3 applications
